"""Vocabulary and enrolment data for the skill-source closure contract.

`docs/SKILL-SOURCES.md` is the recurring-watch registry: one row per
(OMH unit, upstream source) pair, carrying the `reviewed_ref` checkpoint the
external upstream tracker diffs against. The registry has always stated that a
resolved tracker finding must advance `reviewed_ref` and `reviewed_on` in the
same pull request that resolves it, and nothing enforced it, so a merged
capability change could leave the checkpoint behind and let a later run
re-evaluate an already-reviewed range.

This module holds the two frozen tables the validator in
`omh.maintenance.skill_source_closure` reads: the failure vocabulary, and the
pre-receipt baseline that records where every row stood when the contract
shipped. Logic lives in the validator; only data and names live here, the same
split `documentation_navigation` uses.

Nothing here reaches the network, a subprocess, or a watched repository. A
checkpoint value is an opaque identity string, never a git object this code
resolves or orders.
