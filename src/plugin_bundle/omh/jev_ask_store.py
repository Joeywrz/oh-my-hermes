"""Where `omh_jev_ask` finds its route and records what it did -- never a key or any text.

Three things live here, all local:

* The operator setting `<omh_home>/jev/settings.json`. `{"openrouter_route":
  true}` is the only way the OpenRouter route becomes available: an
  `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` on its own is an OpenRouter account, not a request to
  send OMH's questions through it, and treating it as one would make every
  OpenRouter user a Jev user. The same file is the home for the route-question
  answerer opt-in proposed in #1816, so one Jev egress has one consent file.
  OMH never writes it.
* Route availability. The key VALUE is read only at call time, through the
  host's profile-scoped reader (`agent.secret_scope.get_secret`) when Hermes
  is present and `os.environ` only when that import does not exist. A host
  that refuses the read (`UnscopedSecretError` under the multiplexing gateway)
  makes the route unresolvable; OMH never falls back to another source.
* The ask ledger `<omh_home>/jev/asks.jsonl`: one metadata-only line per
  attempted ask, every status included. It carries hashes, counts, statuses,
  usage, and cost, and never the key, `state`, question text, or the reply.
  `omh_route_answer` reads it to confirm an `omh_jev_ask` provenance claim,
  and `omh doctor` reads it for the last status.

Stdlib and intra-bundle imports only.
