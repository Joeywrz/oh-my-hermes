"""What a Jev-class Hermes plugin DECLARES, and nothing about what it does.

Jev (TypeSafe System One) is a non-generative decision model: it answers typed
questions and cannot write code. Several community Hermes plugins call it, and
some of them ask for the same hooks the OMH bridge registers. An operator
deciding whether that matters needs two things, which is all this module
supplies: the plugin names OMH recognizes as Jev-class, and what each one's
catalog entry declares about the tools it registers, the hooks it asks for, and
what leaves the machine.

Every value below is a DECLARATION, never an observation. A catalog description
is written by the plugin's author; a ``plugin.yaml`` under
``$HERMES_HOME/plugins`` is written by whoever installed it. Neither proves the
plugin loaded, that it ran, or that any request left the machine, and no text
built from this module may be read as saying it did. ``read_from`` and
``read_on`` name the artifact and the date each record was transcribed from, so
a reader can check the quote instead of trusting it.

The disclosure strings are copied verbatim from the ``description`` field of
the named catalog entry, folded to one line the way YAML folds a plain
multi-line scalar. A record whose catalog entry carries no ``Disclosure --``
clause holds an empty string rather than a summary OMH invented.

``CLOUDFLARE_JEV_API_TOKEN`` is deliberately absent from
``JEV_CREDENTIAL_ENV_NAMES``: no vendor page and no catalog entry declares that
name, and a credential name OMH made up would be reported as a machine fact.
``OPENROUTER_API_KEY`` is here because two entries below declare it as their
route, and the posture builder only consults it once a Jev-class plugin is
detected -- on its own it is an OpenRouter account, not a Jev signal.

OMH never calls Jev, never reads a credential value, and never imports a
plugin. This module is a table plus one classifier over it, with no I/O.

    plugin matching only the second is reported with ``known: false`` and no
