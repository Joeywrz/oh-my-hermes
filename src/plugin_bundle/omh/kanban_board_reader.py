"""Read-only projection of Hermes Kanban board lanes for the OMH HUD.

Hermes keeps its board in ``kanban.db`` at the Hermes ROOT (shared across
profiles by design: ``<root>/kanban.db`` for the default board,
``<root>/kanban/boards/<slug>/kanban.db`` for a named one, ``HERMES_KANBAN_HOME``
overriding the root, and the session's current board resolved the way the
native tools resolve it: ``HERMES_KANBAN_BOARD``, then ``<root>/kanban/current``,
then ``default``). Workers are detached processes the gateway dispatcher
spawns; the board itself records no token usage and no served-model
observation, so the native status, the assignee and the per-task overrides
are all the board can state on its own.

The worker's own Hermes session records the rest. A dispatched worker runs
under the assignee profile's ``HERMES_HOME``, so its session lives in that
profile's ``state.db`` with ``source = 'kanban'``, and the model, turns, tool
calls, tokens and cost on that row are the same figures the native
delegate_task rows report. ``_worker_usage`` joins them onto a lane row
through the worker's own stamp when there is one and a bounded, uniqueness-
gated dispatch window when there is not; an unlinked row keeps its empty
model and its ``tokens: None``, never a borrowed figure.

This reader opens every database read-only, never writes one, never probes
the gateway and never calls ``hermes kanban``. Every failure is fail-open: a
missing board, a foreign schema, an absent profile home or a lock lost to the
dispatcher all project as "no rows" or "no usage", never as an exception in
the widget's poll.
