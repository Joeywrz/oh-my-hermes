"""Host-side binding for the `omh_loop` tool; the lifecycle lives in OMH core.

Who owns what, and why:

* **OMH core** (`omh.workflows.loop_operations`) owns the Loop operation
  service: the action vocabulary, field validation, the workflow calls, the
  error-code mapping, and the response envelope. The lifecycle it drives is
  thousands of lines of `loop_cycle/v2` rules across a dozen modules. A copy of
  any of that in this bundle would be the CLI/plugin drift the tool exists to
  remove.
* **This module** owns everything core cannot see: which store this call is
  allowed to touch, whether the host gave a session identity, whether the
  caller armed the stale-mutation guard, and what a model-facing payload may
  publish. None of those are answerable from inside a workflow function.

The bundle stays loadable without the `omh` package, so the import is lazy and
guarded, and the failure is closed: with no installed package there is no Loop
state to read, so there is nothing to degrade to. A few core constants are
restated here as literals for the same reason -- `tests/test_loop_tool.py`
pins every one of them against its producer, so a drift is a test failure
rather than a silent disagreement.
