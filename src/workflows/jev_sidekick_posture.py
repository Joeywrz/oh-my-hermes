"""Which Jev-class plugins a Hermes home holds, read and never run.

Jev is a non-generative decision model, so OMH cannot route it as an executor
and never calls it. What an operator still needs to know is whether something
on this machine calls it on their behalf, and whether that something declares
a surface OMH also declares -- most sharply `pre_llm_call`, where OMH injects
its route hint and a Jev skill router nominates a skill, so a message can reach
the model carrying two nominations.

This builder answers that from three local reads and nothing else: the plugin
directories under ``$HERMES_HOME/plugins``, Hermes' ``plugins.enabled`` list,
and the NAMES (never the values) in ``$HERMES_HOME/.env``. It imports no
plugin, spawns nothing, opens no socket, and writes nothing anywhere.

What the tiers mean, and what they do not. ``installed`` means a directory
with a manifest exists. ``enabled`` means Hermes' config lists the name.
``credential_name_present`` means a variable name a Jev plugin declares as its
route appears in the env file. The ladder is monotonic -- each tier requires
the one below it -- so a credential name beside a plugin the operator disabled
reports ``installed``, and ``credential_names_present`` carries the names
regardless so nothing is lost by the collapse. None of the three is evidence
that Jev is served, that the plugin ran, or that any request left the machine.

Every read here can fail to happen, and a read that did not happen is reported
as itself rather than as its commonest result. The manifest reader is the
bounded subset reader in ``plugin_manifest_yaml``, which refuses a construct it
does not model rather than guessing; that refusal is carried, not swallowed,
under ``skipped`` when it left the plugin unclassified and under the plugin's
own ``unreadable_declarations`` when it did not. Enablement is the same rule in
a second place: ``enablement`` is ``unknown``, with a reason, whenever OMH did
not read Hermes' ``plugins`` node or could not establish the name Hermes would
have to list, because "nothing enables it" and "nobody read it" are different
facts about a machine.

Names arriving from the filesystem are untrusted input. A plugin directory name
is chosen by whoever created the directory, never passes the manifest reader's
control-character ban, and lands in a report an operator pastes into a bug
report, so it is stripped of control characters and bounded before it reaches
any payload field or message.
