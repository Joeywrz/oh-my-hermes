"""Static classification of the hooks a Hermes plugin manifest declares.

What this is
------------
A projection of one host contract revision, read from a manifest, for an
operator deciding whether to enable a local plugin. It answers "can a declared
hook block an action, or only watch one", and it answers it without importing,
registering, installing or running anything. Hermes remains authoritative for
loading, registration, dispatch, timeout enforcement and permissions; this is
advisory and offline.

What a declaration is and is not
--------------------------------
`provides_hooks` is author-supplied metadata. Hermes reads it into
`PluginManifest.provides_hooks` (hermes_cli/plugins_manifest.py:422) and
`hermes plugins doctor` validates it -- list, strings, known names
(hermes_cli/plugin_dev.py:300-313) -- but it does so by importing the plugin.
Registration itself happens in code, through `ctx.register_hook()`. So a
declaration never proves that a hook registered, ran, respected its budget, or
handled a failure correctly, and nothing here may be read as saying it did.

Host contract this mapping is pinned to
---------------------------------------
Hermes 0.21.1, tag `v2026.9.7` of NousResearch/hermes-agent. Every value below
is read off that revision:

- The hook vocabulary is `VALID_HOOKS` (hermes_cli/plugins.py:107-188), 37
  names. A name outside it is `unknown`; absence from the mapping is never
  treated as safe.
- `effect` refines the host's own three-value Category column in the shipped
  plugin-hook catalog (website/docs/user-guide/features/hooks.md:439-477).
  "Directive/control" splits into `policy_gate` and
  `prompt_context_contributor`, because only the first can stop an action:
  `pre_tool_call` blocks or approves a tool, `pre_verify` blocks a stop,
  `pre_gateway_dispatch` skips or rewrites a message, whereas `pre_llm_call`'s
  consumed return is joined into the user message and cannot refuse anything.
  "Transform" is `result_transformer`. "Observer" splits into
  `lifecycle_callback` and `observer` by one rule applied to the fire site: a
  hook that marks the creation, teardown, reset or terminal transition of a
  session, a subagent, a kanban task, a kanban worker, or a skill's usage state
  is a lifecycle callback; a hook reporting an operation or field change inside
  a live object's lifetime is an observer.
- `host_contract` is read off the dispatcher:
  `bounded` is `_HOOK_TIMEOUT_BOUNDED_HOOKS` plus
  `_HOOK_TIMEOUT_FAIL_CLOSED_HOOKS` (hermes_cli/plugins_dispatch.py:41 and 48),
  the allowlist `_hook_uses_callback_timeout` consults (line 145-147).
  `queued_worker` is the four streaming observers, which never run inline on
  the token path but on a per-callback bounded queue and daemon worker
  (agent/plugin_stream_hooks.py:1-7, enqueued at agent/stream_delivery.py:38-45
  and 202). `caller_thread` is every remaining hook: unlisted hooks run
  synchronously to completion on the calling thread
  (hermes_cli/plugins_dispatch.py:24-39), and `subagent_stop` is additionally
  pinned there by a documented parent-thread contract (line 50).
- `timeout_semantics` follows from the same place. `pre_tool_call` is the only
  member of `_HOOK_TIMEOUT_FAIL_CLOSED_HOOKS` (line 48): a timed-out or
  still-running callback is turned into a block directive
  (`_pre_tool_call_timeout_block`, applied at line 183), so it fails closed.
  Every other bounded hook is abandoned and skipped, so it fails open (line
  24-25). Nothing outside the allowlist runs under a host timeout at all, so
  `not_applicable` is the honest value there rather than a fail mode that does
  not exist.

What this pin does and does not detect
--------------------------------------
This table is a snapshot, transcribed by hand from the revision named above. It
cannot observe upstream drift, and nothing in this repository reads hermes-agent
at test time or at run time. If Hermes ships a thirty-eighth hook, this file
keeps its 37, the suite stays green, and the new hook classifies `unknown`.

`tests/test_plugin_hook_contract.py` holds a second hand copy of the same
reading. Comparing the two detects a local edit to this table that nobody
intended -- it is a change-detector on the mapping, not a drift-detector on the
host -- and two copies written from one reading agree by construction, so
neither proves the reading was right.

The range binding also does less than its presence suggests, on two counts, and
both belong here rather than in a reader's assumptions. `requires_hermes` is an
OMH convention, not a Hermes field: it is absent from Hermes'
`_KNOWN_MANIFEST_FIELDS` (plugins_manifest.py:31-38) and no code under
`hermes_cli/` or `agent/` reads it. 0 of the 105 manifests shipped at v2026.9.7
declare it -- not merely none of the ten hook-bearing ones -- so for a
third-party plugin the range is `undeclared` and this table applies by default. And nothing here consults the installed host: the audit is offline by
design, so `supported_range` describes the mapping, never the Hermes the
operator is actually running.

What an operator does with `unknown` is therefore load-bearing: it means "not
established here", never "safe" and never "not a real hook". A hook added after
the pinned revision classifies exactly like a name the host never had. Check the
running Hermes version against the `supported_range` the audit reports, and read
the host's own `VALID_HOOKS`, before concluding anything about the plugin.

Re-pinning, when Hermes moves: update `PLUGIN_HOOK_CONTRACT_VERSION`,
`PLUGIN_HOOK_CONTRACT_RANGE` and `PLUGIN_HOOK_CONTRACT_SOURCE`, re-read the four
host constructs cited above, update this table, and update the copy in the test.
`HERMES_COMPAT_MATRIX` in `src/install/plugin_compat.py` records the Hermes
version this repository has actually tested against and already names
`VALID_HOOKS` among its covered host contracts; a test asserts the two agree, so
bumping that matrix without re-reading the hook table fails.
