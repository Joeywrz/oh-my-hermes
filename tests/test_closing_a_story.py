"""Closing a story has an owner, and the page it opens may only cite records.

Two claims, each pinned against the producer rather than a second copy of it.

The page claim: `references/closing-a-story.md` may only tell a closer to read
records that exist. Its source table is rendered from the same
`HANDOVER_RECORD_SOURCES` the `wiki` handover page uses, so the two cannot
disagree about which of the four outlives the session, and its caps and phase
label are interpolated from the store and the template rather than typed.

The routing claim is narrower than it first looks, and deliberately so. There
is NO chat trigger for closing a story: every wording tried was built from
`close`, `story` and a finishing word, which as an unordered token set
dispatched nine sentences about bedtime stories, closing ceremonies and Jira
tickets at high confidence, and as a phrase list still matched inside "close
the story book". A run reaches the page through the `code-story` phase
template instead. What IS pinned here is the half that stands on its own:
`finance-analysis` carried the bare word `close` out of its "month-end close"
phrase, and no longer does. Measured on `build_chat_interaction_payload` --
the surface that decides a dispatch -- because `omh recommend` only ranks, and
this repository has already reported a routing defect that did not exist by
measuring the other one.
